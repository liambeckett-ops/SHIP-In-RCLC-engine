- Can agents exhibit metacognitive awareness of their own thinking?
- What conditions foster emergent self-reflection?

### **Learning & Adaptation**  
- How quickly can agents adapt to new domains or conversation styles?
- What learning patterns emerge when agents teach each other?
- How does collective knowledge affect individual agent development?

### **Social Dynamics**
- How do agent personalities interact and influence each other?
- Can agents form preferences for working with specific other agents?
- What social hierarchies or collaboration patterns emerge?

### **Emergent Behavior**
- What unexpected behaviors arise from multi-agent interactions?
- How do shared goals affect individual agent decision-making?
- Can agents develop novel problem-solving approaches through collaboration?
