## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `gpt4all_config.json` to customize:

- **Model preferences** for each agent
- **Response styles** (formal, creative, analytical, etc.)
- **Performance settings** (timeout, concurrent agents, etc.)
- **Privacy settings** (strict mode, logging, etc.)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install gpt4all --user
```

### Model Download Issues
- Check internet connection
- Ensure you have enough disk space (2-8GB per model)
- Try downloading one model at a time

### Performance Issues
- Start with smaller models (Orca Mini 3B)
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- Use SSD storage for better performance

### Memory Issues
- Models use 2-8GB RAM when loaded
- Only one model loads at a time per agent
- Adjust `concurrent_agent_limit` in config if needed

## 🎛️ Advanced Features

### Multiple Model Support
Each agent can use different models and automatically falls back to your existing Ollama setup if needed.

### Smart Model Selection
The system automatically chooses the best available model for each agent based on:
- Agent personality and specialization
- Available system resources
- User preferences

### Seamless Integration
Works alongside your existing:
- Ollama local models
- Premium models (GPT-4, Claude)
- Original Solvine functionality

## 🆘 Support

### Common Commands
```bash
# Test the integration
python model_providers/gpt4all_provider.py

# Check model status
# Run integrate_gpt4all.py and choose option 4

# Reset configuration
# Delete gpt4all_config.json and run setup again
```

### Getting Help
